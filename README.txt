Description: 
This program is a quick code I wrote a few years ago that was made to turn a text file with binary values and comments into a file with just binary values. 

Motivation: 
This was to make a course I was taking at the time easier. We needed a .txt file that only contained binary values to act as an instruction file for a cpu we made in verilog. 

How it works: 
Download Output_Binary.exe and My_input_file.txt and keep them in the same folder. 


TODO:
-Refactor and recomment **COMPLETE**
-Make it so that 0's and 1's in the comments will not be interprete as code. 
-Make code more portable and self contained

Maybe:
-Make tiny pop-up window to notify success
-Make an Windows installer so that it's already on $PATH?
